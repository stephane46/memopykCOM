ISSUE: Container starts successfully but DATABASE_PASSWORD not found in container environment

CONTAINER STATUS:
✅ Container builds and starts successfully
✅ Health endpoint responds (HTTP/1.1 200 OK)  
✅ Static files served correctly
❌ Database connection fails: "DATABASE_PASSWORD environment variable is required"

ROOT CAUSE:
The DATABASE_PASSWORD is set in the .env file but not being passed to the container properly.

SOLUTION REQUIRED:
1. Show .env file content to verify DATABASE_PASSWORD is present
2. Test container environment variables to see what's actually available
3. Debug why DATABASE_PASSWORD isn't reaching the container
